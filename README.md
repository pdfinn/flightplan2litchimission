# flightplan2litchimission
`fp2lm` is a tool for converting the output generated by the [flight_planner](https://github.com/JMG30/flight_planner) plugin for [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) to a [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com) mission.

The tool expects a CSV file of waypoints.  Litchi limits missions to 99 waypoints; therefore, for this workflow, waypoints are only used for course changes.  Photograph intervals be set by measuring the distance between projection centres in QGIS, and configuring Litchi to photograph at equal distance intervals.  This technique will produce sufficient results for most applications. 

Usage: `% fp2lm FlightplannerMission.csv > LitchiMission.csv`
